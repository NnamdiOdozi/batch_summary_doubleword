### 7. Technical Content

The document introduces the **AI, Data Science and Emerging Technologies Practice Board** of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA), established in November 2025. This board is a member-led initiative created in collaboration between the IFoA Council and the IFoA AI and Data Science Community. Its primary mission is to guide the actuarial profession through the transformative impact of artificial intelligence, data science, and emerging technologies on both professional practice and broader societal systems.

#### Historical Context and Evolution

The practice area traces its origins to a working party formed in 2018, which succeeded the earlier **Modelling, Analytics and Insights from Data Working Party**. This working party evolved into the **AI and Data Science Community**, which eventually led to the formal establishment of the Practice Board. This evolution reflects the growing importance and institutional recognition of data-driven methodologies and AI in actuarial science.

The Practice Board is structured to serve as a central hub for members interested in AI, data science, and emerging technologies. Its vision is to become a **centre of excellence** — the primary interface between the IFoA and its members who wish to engage with these fields. The board aims to foster innovation, ensure ethical application of technologies, and maintain the relevance and leadership of actuaries in a rapidly digitizing world.

#### Core Pillars of the Practice Board

The board’s activities are organized around four foundational pillars:

1. **Lifelong Learning**  
   Led by Alexey Mashechkin (Lifelong Learning Lead) and Eilish Bouse (Deputy Lead), this pillar focuses on continuous professional development. It includes the creation of educational content, training modules, webinars, and digital learning platforms to help actuaries stay current with technological advancements. The goal is to ensure that members can adapt their skill sets to new tools and methodologies, such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and big data technologies.

2. **Research**  
   Headed by Alexis Iglauer (Research Lead) and Dylan Liew (Research Deputy Lead), this pillar drives the board’s scholarly output. It oversees active research working parties that produce technical papers, case studies, and white papers on topics at the intersection of actuarial science and emerging technologies. These working parties explore how AI can be applied to risk modeling, pricing, reserving, customer segmentation, and regulatory compliance. The research output is intended to inform both professional practice and public policy.

3. **Engagement**  
   Led by Malgorzata Smietanka (Collaboration and External Engagement Lead), this pillar promotes dialogue between the IFoA, industry stakeholders, academia, and regulatory bodies. It organizes events, conferences, and panel discussions to facilitate knowledge exchange. Engagement also includes outreach to non-actuarial audiences to explain the role of actuaries in the age of AI and to advocate for responsible technology adoption.

4. **Professionalism and Ethics**  
   Matthew Byrne serves as the Professionalism and Ethics Lead. This pillar addresses the ethical, legal, and societal implications of deploying AI and data science in actuarial contexts. It develops guidelines and frameworks for responsible AI use, including transparency, fairness, accountability, and bias mitigation. Given the high-stakes nature of actuarial decisions (e.g., insurance pricing, pension funding, solvency assessments), ethical considerations are paramount. The board works to ensure that actuaries uphold professional standards while leveraging new technologies.

#### Leadership Structure

The board is chaired by **Asif John**, with **John Ng** serving as Deputy Chair. The leadership team is composed of subject matter experts from diverse actuarial domains, ensuring that the board’s initiatives are grounded in practical industry needs as well as academic rigor. The inclusion of both leads and deputy leads across each pillar ensures continuity and collaborative governance.

#### Deliverables and Activities

The Practice Board delivers a range of content and services to its members:

- **Research Papers and Case Studies**: These documents explore real-world applications of AI and data science in actuarial contexts. Examples may include using machine learning to predict claim frequencies, applying natural language processing to policy documents, or using clustering algorithms to segment customer risk profiles.
  
- **Webinars and Events**: Regular virtual and in-person events feature guest speakers from industry, academia, and regulatory bodies. Topics may include “Explainable AI in Insurance,” “Ethics of Algorithmic Pricing,” or “Regulatory Challenges in AI-Driven Actuarial Models.”

- **Education and Training**: The board collaborates with the IFoA’s Virtual Learning Environment to develop courses on data science fundamentals, Python for actuaries, machine learning basics, and ethical AI. These resources are designed to be accessible to actuaries at all career stages.

- **Digital Community Platform**: A new digital platform enables member-to-member engagement, knowledge sharing, and open discussion. This fosters a collaborative ecosystem where actuaries can exchange ideas, ask questions, and collaborate on projects.

#### Strategic Importance

The formation of the Practice Board is positioned as a strategic response to the rapid pace of technological change. Actuaries, traditionally known for their expertise in risk assessment and financial modeling, are now expected to integrate data science and AI into their workflows. The board ensures that the profession remains relevant and competitive by:

- Equipping actuaries with modern analytical tools.
- Promoting innovation in actuarial methodologies.
- Advocating for ethical and responsible use of technology.
- Bridging the gap between actuarial science and data science communities.

#### Broader Societal Impact

Beyond professional development, the board recognizes that AI and data science have profound societal implications. Actuaries play a critical role in designing insurance products, pension schemes, and risk management systems that affect millions of people. The board seeks to ensure that these systems are fair, transparent, and equitable. For example, AI-driven pricing models must not perpetuate discrimination or bias, and predictive models must be explainable to regulators and consumers.

#### Future Directions

While the document does not outline specific technical roadmaps, it implies that future initiatives will likely include:

- Development of AI literacy programs for actuaries.
- Creation of benchmark datasets or synthetic data environments for testing actuarial AI models.
- Collaboration with regulatory bodies to shape AI governance frameworks.
- Publication of open-source tools or templates for common actuarial AI applications (e.g., claim prediction, reserve estimation).

#### Limitations and Gaps

The document is purely organizational and does not provide technical depth on any AI or data science methodologies. It does not discuss:

- Specific algorithms or model architectures.
- Performance metrics or evaluation frameworks.
- Computational infrastructure or scalability considerations.
- Data privacy or security protocols.

These omissions are understandable given the document’s purpose — it is not a technical paper but a strategic overview. However, for readers seeking technical implementation details, this document serves only as a high-level introduction to the IFoA’s institutional response to technological change.

#### Conclusion

The **AI, Data Science and Emerging Technologies Practice Board** represents a forward-looking initiative by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries to ensure that actuaries remain at the forefront of technological innovation. By focusing on lifelong learning, research, engagement, and ethics, the board aims to equip its members with the knowledge and tools needed to navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by AI and data science. While the document does not delve into technical modeling or code implementation, it lays the groundwork for future technical collaborations, research outputs, and educational initiatives that will likely fill these gaps in the coming years.

The board’s success will depend on its ability to translate strategic vision into actionable technical content — such as open-source code repositories, standardized datasets, and reproducible case studies — that actuaries can directly apply in their work. As AI continues to reshape the financial services industry, the IFoA’s proactive stance positions the actuarial profession as a leader in responsible, data-driven decision-making.
