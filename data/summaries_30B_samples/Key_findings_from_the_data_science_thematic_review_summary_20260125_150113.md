### 7. Technical Content

The document is a summary of a thematic review conducted by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) titled *“Actuaries using data science and artificial intelligence techniques.”* It was presented in a webinar on March 19, 2024, and the full report was published on February 26, 2024. The review is not a technical paper on modeling or algorithmic innovation but rather a professional and regulatory assessment of how actuaries are engaging with data science and AI in practice.

#### Purpose and Scope of the Review

The IFoA conducts regular thematic reviews to evaluate how actuaries perform their work in real-world settings. This particular review focuses on the growing intersection of actuarial science with data science and artificial intelligence. It aims to:

- Identify how actuaries are currently applying or planning to apply data science and AI in their work.
- Examine the risks and challenges associated with these applications.
- Assess the evolving regulatory and standards landscape globally.
- Provide guidance to actuaries, regulators, and employers on best practices and professional responsibilities.

The review is not intended to be a technical manual but rather a risk and governance framework for professionals navigating the adoption of AI and data science tools.

#### Key Findings from the Review

The webinar and report highlight several key areas of concern and opportunity for actuaries engaging with data science and AI:

##### 1. Actuarial Involvement in Data Science Projects

Actuaries are increasingly involved in data science initiatives, particularly in insurance, pensions, and financial services. Their traditional skills in statistical modeling, risk assessment, and financial forecasting are highly transferable to data science roles. However, the review notes that actuaries often participate in these projects in supporting or advisory capacities rather than as lead data scientists.

- Actuaries are frequently involved in model validation, governance, and interpretation rather than model building.
- Many actuaries are upskilling in programming, machine learning, and data visualization to remain competitive.
- There is a growing demand for actuaries who can bridge the gap between technical data science teams and business stakeholders.

##### 2. Areas of Potential Risk

The review identifies several risks associated with the use of AI and data science by actuaries:

- **Model Risk:** Actuaries may not fully understand the inner workings of complex machine learning models (e.g., deep learning, ensemble methods), leading to potential misinterpretation or misuse.
- **Bias and Fairness:** AI models can inadvertently perpetuate or amplify biases present in training data, which is particularly concerning in insurance pricing and underwriting.
- **Transparency and Explainability:** Many AI models are “black boxes,” making it difficult for actuaries to explain decisions to regulators, clients, or auditors — a core requirement in actuarial practice.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Actuaries must ensure that AI-driven decisions comply with local and international regulations (e.g., GDPR, Solvency II, IFRS 17).
- **Professional Accountability:** Actuaries must take responsibility for the outcomes of AI models they endorse or use, even if they did not build them.

##### 3. Regulatory and Standards Landscape

The review emphasizes that the regulatory environment for AI and data science is rapidly evolving. Key developments include:

- **Global Standards:** Organizations such as the International Actuarial Association (IAA) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) are developing guidelines for the use of AI in financial services.
- **National Regulations:** Countries are introducing AI-specific regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, UK AI Regulation White Paper) that may impact actuarial work.
- **Professional Standards:** The IFoA is updating its Code of Conduct and Technical Standards to address AI and data science. Actuaries are expected to adhere to principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability when using these technologies.

##### 4. Case Studies

The review includes several case studies (though not detailed in the webinar summary) illustrating how actuaries are applying data science and AI in practice. These include:

- **Insurance Pricing:** Using machine learning to refine risk segmentation and pricing models.
- **Claims Prediction:** Applying predictive analytics to estimate future claims and reserve requirements.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Leveraging AI to understand policyholder behavior and improve retention.
- **Fraud Detection:** Implementing anomaly detection algorithms to identify suspicious claims.

In each case, the review highlights the importance of actuarial oversight, model validation, and ethical considerations.

##### 5. Recommendations for Actuaries

The IFoA provides several recommendations for actuaries engaging with data science and AI:

- **Upskill Continuously:** Actuaries should develop foundational knowledge in data science, machine learning, and programming (e.g., Python, R).
- **Collaborate Across Disciplines:** Work closely with data scientists, IT professionals, and legal/compliance teams to ensure robust model development and governance.
- **Prioritize Explainability:** Choose or adapt models that can be explained to stakeholders, even if they are less accurate than “black box” alternatives.
- **Document Thoroughly:** Maintain clear documentation of model assumptions, data sources, validation procedures, and limitations.
- **Engage with Regulators:** Proactively communicate with regulators about AI usage and seek guidance when necessary.

##### 6. Future Outlook

The review concludes that the integration of data science and AI into actuarial practice is inevitable and beneficial — but must be managed responsibly. Actuaries have a unique opportunity to lead in the ethical and professional use of these technologies. The IFoA plans to continue monitoring this space and updating its guidance as the landscape evolves.

#### Implications for Undergraduate STEM Students

For undergraduate students in STEM fields (particularly those interested in actuarial science, data science, or financial engineering), this review highlights several important trends:

- **Interdisciplinary Skills Are Essential:** Future actuaries will need to combine traditional actuarial knowledge with data science skills.
- **Ethics and Governance Matter:** Technical proficiency alone is not sufficient — understanding regulatory, ethical, and professional responsibilities is critical.
- **Lifelong Learning Is Required:** The rapid evolution of AI and data science means continuous learning and adaptation are necessary.
- **Communication Is Key:** Being able to explain complex models to non-technical stakeholders is a valuable skill.

Students should consider courses in machine learning, programming, ethics, and regulatory compliance to prepare for careers at the intersection of actuarial science and data science.
